In this project you can have a calculator on your browser ðŸ˜…

But having a calculator on a browser makes a lot of sense because a lot of sites do that for us, but this calculator is different from other calculators ðŸ¤”

Bur what a difference ðŸ¤”

The difference between this calculator and other calculators is that this calculator has a strong UI! Because a lot of work has been done to design it and it also creates a sense of nostalgia ðŸ¤©
